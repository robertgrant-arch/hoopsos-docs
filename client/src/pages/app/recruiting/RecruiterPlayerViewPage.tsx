      "Jordan has demonstrated exceptional development in his shooting mechanics over the past three cycles. His off-ball movement and catch-and-shoot preparation place him among the top shooting guards I've evaluated at this level. What separates Jordan from comparable prospects is his willingness to engage with film — he reviews sessions independently and consistently applies corrections in subsequent practices. His IDP focus area (off-dribble pull-up) has shown measurable improvement (+1.2 delta). He arrives early, stays late, and never needs to be reminded of his responsibilities. At the D1 level, his basketball IQ and coachability profile suggest he will develop further under high-level instruction. High-major programs should be evaluating him now.",

He processes the floor in real time and makes decisions two possessions ahead. His finishing has improved most dramatically (+1.1) as we worked on contact layup packages this fall. He reviews his own film before I ask. He leads our IDP cohort discussions. He's earned every badge he holds. Any program recruiting at the major level should be scheduling in-person evaluation immediately.",
