# HoopsOS: Marketing Site Architecture & Scaffolding

This document outlines the public marketing presence for HoopsOS. It translates the premium, cinematic brand energy into a high-converting web surface, differentiating the value proposition for athletes, coaches, teams, and experts.

## 1. Messaging Architecture

### Value Proposition
**The unified basketball development operating system.**
HoopsOS replaces the fragmented mess of YouTube drills, text message assignments, and scattered film links with a single, elite platform. It is MasterClass-quality instruction meets Peloton-level momentum, built on a professional coaching foundation.

### Audience-Specific Hooks
*   **Athletes:** "Stop guessing. Execute daily WODs, get AI feedback on your mechanics, and train with the world's best."
*   **Coaches:** "Your entire program, centralized. Assign film, telestrate breakdowns, build animated playbooks, and track compliance instantly."
*   **Teams/Orgs:** "Standardize excellence. Equip every coach with elite tools and give every athlete a 50% discount on their personal development."
*   **Experts:** "Monetize your mastery. Sell courses, host live clinics, and provide 1:1 film reviews to a captive, global audience of serious players."

### Objection Handling
*   *Objection:* "It's too expensive for my high school team."
    *   *Rebuttal:* The Team Plan is a flat rate for coaches. Athletes on your roster automatically unlock a 50% lifetime discount on their individual Player App subscription.
*   *Objection:* "AI can't replace a real coach."
    *   *Rebuttal:* It doesn't. AI handles the baseline mechanics (posture, shot angle) so coaches can focus on high-level basketball IQ and situational decision-making.

## 2. Page-by-Page Wireframes (Real Copy)

### `/` (Homepage)
*   **Cinematic Hero:** Full-bleed dark video background (Mux playlist). Slow-motion, high-contrast shot of a player executing a drill, overlaid with a coach's telestration.
    *   *Headline:* THE UNIFIED BASKETBALL OS.
    *   *Subhead:* Elite instruction. AI-powered mechanics. Professional film tools. One platform to build your game or run your program.
    *   *Dual CTA:* [ Start Training (Primary) ] [ Explore Coach HQ (Secondary) ]
*   **Audience Pivot:** Three massive `MediaCard` blocks side-by-side.
    *   *For Players:* "Execute Daily WODs. Track XP. Level Up."
    *   *For Coaches:* "Assign Film. Draw Plays. Demand Accountability."
    *   *For Experts:* "Teach the World. Build Your Business."
*   **Feature Split (AI Feedback):** Left: Video of a jump shot with AI skeleton overlay. Right: "Don't just rep. Rep right. Our AI engine analyzes your shot arc, base width, and release point in seconds."
*   **Live Class Teaser:** A horizontal scrolling shelf of `ClassCard`s showing upcoming sessions. "Train live with NBA trainers and Division 1 coaches."

### `/players`
*   **Hero:** "Your Daily Blueprint for Greatness."
*   **Feature Grid:**
    *   *Daily WODs:* "Wake up. Open the app. Execute the day's program."
    *   *AI Mechanics:* "Upload your film. Get instant, objective feedback on your form."
    *   *Gamification:* "Build your streak. Earn XP. Unlock elite skill tracks."
*   **Price Anchor:** "Player Core: $19.99/mo. *Play for a HoopsOS Team? Get 50% off for life.*"

### `/coaches`
*   **Hero:** "The Command Center for Elite Programs."
*   **Feature Showcase:**
    *   *Film Room:* "Upload game tape. Add timestamped comments. Draw directly on the frame."
    *   *Playbook Studio:* "Ditch the whiteboard marker. Build animated plays and test your roster's comprehension with quizzes."
    *   *Compliance Dashboard:* "Know exactly who watched the film and who skipped the workout."
*   **CTA:** [ Start Your 14-Day Coach Trial ]

### `/teams`
*   **Hero:** "Standardize Excellence Across Your Organization."
*   **Value Prop:** "Equip your entire coaching staff with professional tools, and give every athlete in your program a massive advantage."
*   **The 50% Rule:** A visual diagram showing how buying a Team Plan instantly triggers a 50% discount for every athlete on the roster.
*   **CTA:** [ Request a Demo ] (Opens a lead capture form).

### `/experts`

*   **Showcase:** A grid of `ExpertProfileHero` cards featuring current top earners.
*   **How it Works:** "1. Apply and verify your credentials. 2. Set your rates for 1:1 film reviews and live classes. 3. Get paid automatically via Stripe."
*   **CTA:** [ Apply to Teach ]

### `/pricing`
*   **Matrix:** Three distinct columns (Player Core, Coach Core, Team Pro).
*   **Add-Ons:** A section below for "Premium Expert Content (Priced a la carte)".
*   **FAQ Drawer:** Accordions addressing the team discount, cancellation policies, and parent-child billing.

### `/live`
*   **Hero:** "The Global Hardwood. Live."
*   **Grid:** `LiveClassPoster` components. Filterable by "Upcoming", "Free for Members", "Premium".
*   **Countdown:** A prominent ticker for the next major MasterClass event.

## 3. Conversion Strategy

*   **Primary CTAs:** Always solid Amber (`bg-primary`). Direct to the Clerk sign-up flow with role pre-selection.
*   **Secondary CTAs:** Zinc-800 (`bg-secondary`). Direct to feature deep-dives or demo requests.
*   **Micro-Conversions:**
    *   *Join Waitlist:* On `/live` for upcoming premium classes.
    *   *Download Playbook:* On `/coaches`, a lead-magnet offering a free PDF of animated plays in exchange for an email.
    *   *Parent Link:* On `/pricing`, a clear path for parents to create an account and buy a sub for their child without cluttering their own profile.

## 4. Component Structure (Marketing)

The marketing site relies on a set of reusable Server Components built on top of the design system.

*   `CinematicHero`: A full-width section taking a `videoUrl` (Mux MP4 fallback), a massive `headline` (Oswald), `subhead`, and `children` (for CTAs). It applies the `bg-black/60` gradient overlay.
*   `FeatureSplit`: A standard alternating left/right layout. Takes `media` (video/image) and `content`. Uses `motion.div` for scroll-linked fade-ins.
*   `AudiencePivot`: A 3-column grid specifically for the Player/Coach/Expert routing on the homepage. Uses `MediaCard` variants.
*   `PricingMatrix`: A highly structured table component. Takes a JSON array of plans and features, rendering checkmarks or limits. Includes the toggle for Monthly/Annual.
*   `ExpertShowcase`: A horizontal scrolling carousel of `ExpertProfileHero` cards.

## 5. High-Fidelity Frontend Scaffolding (Next.js)

Below is the foundational code for the `(marketing)` route group, establishing the layout shell and the cinematic homepage.

## 6. SEO & Metadata Strategy

HoopsOS utilizes Next.js App Router's native Metadata API to ensure high visibility and rich social sharing cards.

### Metadata Patterns
*   **Title Template:** `%s | HoopsOS`
*   **OG Image Pattern:** Dynamic Open Graph images generated via `@vercel/og`.
    *   *Default:* The HoopsOS logo centered on a dark hardwood texture.
    *   *Expert Profile:* The expert's avatar on the left, their name and "HoopsOS Expert" on the right.
    *   *Live Class:* The class title, date, and instructor avatar.

### JSON-LD Structured Data
JSON-LD is injected into the `<head>` of specific pages to secure rich snippets in Google search results.

*   **Homepage (`/`)**: `Organization` and `SoftwareApplication` schemas.
*   **Pricing (`/pricing`)**: `Product` schema with `offers` (prices and currencies).
*   **Live Classes (`/live/[id]`)**: `Event` schema (including `startDate`, `endDate`, `performer`, and `offers`).
*   **Expert Directory (`/experts/[id]`)**: `Person` schema.

*Example Next.js Implementation (`src/app/(marketing)/live/[id]/page.tsx`):*
```tsx
import Script from "next/script";

export default function LiveClassPage({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const jsonLd = {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Event",
    "name": "Advanced Pick & Roll Reads",
    "startDate": "2026-05-15T18:00:00-05:00",
    "performer": {
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "Coach Smith"
    },
    "offers": {
      "@type": "Offer",
      "price": "25.00",
      "priceCurrency": "USD"
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Script
        id="json-ld-event"
        type="application/ld+json"
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(jsonLd) }}
      />
      {/* Page Content */}
    </>
  );
}
```

## 7. Analytics & Measurement Plan

Measurement is focused on identifying which audience segment converts best and where drop-offs occur in the multi-step onboarding flows.

### Event Taxonomy
*   `marketing_view_pricing`: Triggered when the pricing matrix enters the viewport.
*   `marketing_click_cta`: Triggered on any primary/secondary CTA click. Properties: `target_role` (athlete, coach, team), `location` (hero, footer).
*   `marketing_play_video`: Triggered when the AI demo or a MasterClass trailer is played.
*   `marketing_lead_capture`: Triggered when a team requests a demo or downloads a playbook.

### UTM Conventions
*   `utm_source`: e.g., `instagram`, `tiktok`, `google`, `coach_referral`.
*   `utm_medium`: e.g., `paid_social`, `organic`, `email`.
*   `utm_campaign`: e.g., `summer_grind_2026`, `team_discount_launch`.

### A/B Test Hook Points
*   **Homepage Hero CTA:** Test `[ Start Training ]` vs. `[ See How It Works ]`.
*   **Pricing Page:** Test showing the Annual toggle by default vs. Monthly by default.

## 8. Legal & Trust Elements

Given the target demographic (youth athletes and institutional schools), the legal and trust surfaces are not an afterthought—they are a core conversion asset.

### Youth Privacy (COPPA) Surface
*   **Location:** `/legal/youth` (linked prominently in the footer and during athlete sign-up).
*   **Content:** Plain-English explanation of how HoopsOS handles data for users under 13.
*   **Key Trust Points:**
    *   "We never sell athlete data."
    *   "Direct messaging between adults and minors is disabled; parents are always in the loop."
    *   "AI pose estimation data is anonymized and used strictly for personal feedback."

### Accessibility Statement
*   **Location:** Footer link.
*   **Content:** Commitment to WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Highlights support for screen readers, keyboard navigation in Coach HQ, and the `prefers-reduced-motion` toggle.

### Terms & Conditions
*   **Location:** `/legal/terms`
*   **Content:** Standard SaaS terms, plus specific clauses for the Expert Marketplace (payout schedules, content ownership) and the Team 50% discount rules (revocation conditions).
