# HoopsOS: Film Room Architecture & Scaffolding

This document details the `(film)` route group, the collaborative video analysis engine for teams. It covers the coach's workflow for clipping and assigning film, the player's inbox experience, granular watch-tracking, and comprehension quizzes.

## 1. Route Structure `(film)`

The Film Room is split into two distinct surfaces: the Coach's command center and the Player's inbox.

**Coach Surfaces:**
*   `/(film)` - The team's central repository of uploaded games and practices.
*   `/(film)/rooms/[roomId]` - A specific game or event (e.g., "State Championship vs. West High").
*   `/(film)/rooms/[roomId]/clips/[clipId]` - The telestration and tagging workspace for a specific play.
*   `/(film)/rooms/[roomId]/assignments` - The dashboard tracking who has watched which clips and their quiz scores.

**Player Surfaces:**
*   `/(film)/player/inbox` - The athlete's to-do list of assigned film.
*   `/(film)/player/clips/[clipId]` - The immersive viewing experience with telestration overlays, quizzes, and the "Acknowledge" button.

## 2. Schema Usage

Building on the canonical schema (Prompt 3), the Film Room utilizes the following entities:

*   `FilmRoom`: A container for a game or practice (`id`, `teamId`, `title`, `date`, `fullGameMuxId`).
*   `FilmClip`: A specific segment of a room (`id`, `roomId`, `title`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `muxAssetId`).
*   `TelestrationAnnotation`: Drawing data tied to a clip (`id`, `clipId`, `timestampSec`, `drawDataJson`, `authorId`).
*   `FilmAssignment`: The task given to an athlete (`id`, `clipId`, `assigneeId`, `dueDate`, `status: PENDING | WATCHED | ACKNOWLEDGED`, `score`).
*   `FilmWatchEvent`: Raw telemetry (`id`, `assignmentId`, `eventType: PLAY | PAUSE | SEEK | END`, `timestampSec`, `createdAt`).
*   `FilmQuiz`: A comprehension test attached to a clip (`id`, `clipId`, `question`, `type: MCQ | TIMED_READ`, `optionsJson`, `correctOption`).
*   `FilmQuizAttempt`: The athlete's answer (`id`, `quizId`, `assigneeId`, `selectedOption`, `isCorrect`, `timeTakenMs`).

## 3. Watch-Tracking Event Model

To ensure accountability, coaches need proof that athletes actually watched the assigned film, not just clicked "Mark as Read."

*   **Granular Events:** The Mux player emits events (`playing`, `pause`, `seeked`, `ended`). A custom React hook debounces these events and sends them to a `/api/film/telemetry` endpoint, creating `FilmWatchEvent` records.
*   **Session Aggregation:** A background cron job (or materialized view) aggregates the raw events to calculate the true `percentageWatched`. If an athlete skips from 0:00 to 5:00, the intervening time is not counted.
*   **Resume Position:** The last `PAUSE` or `SEEK` event updates a `lastWatchedPosition` field on the `FilmAssignment`, allowing the athlete to resume exactly where they left off across devices.
*   **Completion Threshold:** An assignment automatically transitions from `PENDING` to `WATCHED` when `percentageWatched` crosses 90%.

## 4. Quiz Model & Grading Logic

Quizzes ensure active comprehension of the film. They interrupt playback at specific timestamps.

*   **Multiple Choice (MCQ):** The standard format. The video pauses, the telestration canvas dims, and a modal asks, "What was the correct rotation here?"
*   **Identify-Action:** The video pauses, and the athlete must click a specific area on the video frame (e.g., "Click the player who missed the box-out"). The `optionsJson` defines a valid `x,y` bounding box.
*   **Timed Reads:** The video plays at full speed, pauses for exactly 2 seconds, and the athlete must answer a read-and-react question (e.g., "Shoot or Pass?") within a time limit, simulating in-game pressure.
*   **Grading:** `FilmQuizAttempt` records are evaluated immediately. The aggregate score is saved to `FilmAssignment.score`. If the score is below a coach-defined threshold (e.g., 80%), the assignment status remains `PENDING` and prompts a re-watch.

## 5. Coach Compliance Dashboards

The `/(film)/rooms/[roomId]/assignments` route is the coach's accountability hub. It provides a dense, scannable overview of team engagement.

*   **The Heatmap:** A data table where rows are athletes and columns are assigned clips. Cells are color-coded:
    *   *Green:* 100% watched, quiz passed, acknowledged.
    *   *Yellow:* Partial watch or quiz failed.
    *   *Red:* Unwatched past the due date.
*   **Quiz Analytics:** A breakdown of `FilmQuiz` performance. If 80% of the team missed the "Identify the low-man rotation" question, the coach knows what to emphasize in the next live practice.
*   **Acknowledge CTA Tracking:** Coaches can see exactly when an athlete clicked the "I understand this read" button, creating an undeniable audit trail of coaching feedback.

## 6. Player Inbox UX

The `/(film)/player/inbox` is designed for low cognitive load. It surfaces only what the athlete needs to do right now.

*   **The Queue:** A prioritized list of `FilmAssignment` cards. Overdue items are pinned to the top with a red warning badge.
*   **The "Acknowledge" Button:** The primary CTA on a clip detail page (`/(film)/player/clips/[clipId]`). It only unlocks *after* the `percentageWatched` hits the required threshold and any attached `FilmQuiz` is passed. Clicking it transitions the assignment to `ACKNOWLEDGED`.
*   **Completion Check:** A prominent progress ring (e.g., "4/5 Clips Reviewed") gamifies the film session, encouraging the athlete to clear their inbox.

## 7. Mux Signed URLs & Privacy Scopes

Game film is highly sensitive proprietary data. HoopsOS strictly controls access using Mux Signed URLs.

1.  **Private Assets:** When a coach uploads a full game to Mux, the asset is created with `playback_policy: ["signed"]`. The public Mux URL will return a 403 Forbidden.
2.  **Per-Clip Scope:** When an athlete requests a clip, the Next.js server verifies their `FilmAssignment` via Prisma.
3.  **Token Minting:** If authorized, the server generates a short-lived (e.g., 2-hour) JWT using the Mux Signing Key. This token is appended to the playback URL (e.g., `https://stream.mux.com/{PLAYBACK_ID}.m3u8?token={JWT}`).
4.  **Expiration:** Once the token expires, the video stops playing, preventing athletes from sharing links with rival teams.

## 8. Permissions & Authorization

The Film Room enforces strict boundaries between creators (coaches) and consumers (athletes).

*   **Coach-Only Actions:** Only users with `TEAM_ADMIN` or `ASSISTANT_COACH` roles for the specific `teamId` can upload full games, create clips, draw telestration annotations, and create assignments. This is enforced by `Policy.canAssignFilm(sessionClaims, teamId)`.
*   **Read-Only Athletes:** Athletes cannot browse the entire `FilmRoom` library. They only have read access to the specific `FilmClip` entities explicitly assigned to them via a `FilmAssignment`. This prevents overwhelming the athlete and protects sensitive scouting footage.

## 9. Mobile Usability

Athletes consume film primarily on their phones, often on the bus or in the locker room.

*   **Portrait Film View:** The `/(film)/player/clips/[clipId]` page defaults to portrait mode. The video player occupies the top third of the screen.
*   **Chapter List:** The bottom two-thirds displays a scrollable list of timestamps (telestration annotations or quizzes). Tapping a timestamp seeks the video to that exact moment.
*   **Swipe-to-Comment:** Athletes can swipe left on a specific timestamp to open a quick-reply input, allowing them to ask a clarifying question directly to the coach without leaving the playback context.
*   **Landscape Full-Screen:** Rotating the device forces the video to full-screen landscape, hiding the chapter list but keeping telestration overlays active.
