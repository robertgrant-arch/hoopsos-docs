## 4. Role-Based Navigation Model

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Athlete** | Dashboard, Workouts, Film, Classes | Profile, Settings, Billing | "Upload Film", "Start WOD" |
| **Coach** | Dashboard, Athletes, Reviews, Playbook | Education, Profile, Settings | "New Review", "Draw Play" |

| **Super Admin** | Users, Orgs, Content, Financials | System Settings | "Impersonate User" |

## 5. Shared vs. Role-Specific Routes & Access Rules

*   **Shared Routes**: `/(marketing)/*`, `/(auth)/*`, `/(live)/[roomId]`. Accessible based on authentication state and specific event registration.
*   **Role-Specific Routes**:
    *   `/(player)/*`: Restricted to `ATHLETE` and `PARENT` (read-only child view).
    *   `/(coach)/*`: Restricted to `COACH`, `ASSISTANT_COACH`, `EXPERT`.
    *   `/(team)/*`: Restricted to `TEAM_ADMIN`, `ORG_ADMIN`, `COACH`.
    *   `/(marketplace)/*`: Restricted to `EXPERT`.
    *   `/(admin)/*`: Restricted to `SUPER_ADMIN`.
*   **Access Rules**: Enforced via Next.js Middleware for route protection and Prisma extensions for tenant/data isolation.

## 6. Onboarding Route Flows

1.  **Athlete**: Sign Up → `/(onboarding)/athlete/goals` (Age, Skill Level, Goals) → `/(player)/dashboard` (First WOD highlighted).
2.  **Coach**: Sign Up → `/(onboarding)/coach/setup` (Experience, Focus) → `/(coach)/dashboard` → Prompt to "Create Team" or "Invite Athletes".
3.  **Team Admin**: Sign Up → `/(onboarding)/team/org` (Org Setup) → `/(onboarding)/team/create` (Team Creation) → `/(team)/roster` (Roster Import/Invites).
4.  **Expert**: Sign Up → `/(onboarding)/expert/verify` (Verification/Stripe Connect) → `/(marketplace)/dashboard` → Prompt to "Publish Offers".
5.  **Parent**: Sign Up → `/(onboarding)/parent/link` (Link Child via Email/Code) → `/(player)/dashboard` (Read-only view).

## 7. Deep-Link & Notification Patterns

*   **New Coach Comment**: Links directly to the specific timestamp in the film room.
    *   URL: `/app/player/film/vid_123?t=45&commentId=cmt_456`
*   **Live Class Starting**: Links directly to the live room.
    *   URL: `/app/live/room_789`
*   **New Film Assignment**: Links to the team film room assignment.
    *   URL: `/app/team/film-room/assign_012`
*   **Discount Entitlement Granted**: Links to the athlete's billing page with the discount applied.
    *   URL: `/app/player/profile?tab=billing&discount=team_50`

## 8. Mobile-First Responsive Considerations

*   **Mobile-Primary Surfaces**:
    *   **Player App**: Designed for on-court use. Large touch targets, portrait video for drills, swipe gestures for WOD progression.
    *   **Live Classes (Viewer)**: Optimized for mobile viewing, chat overlay.
*   **Desktop-Primary Surfaces (Coach/Admin)**:
    *   **Coach HQ (Reviews & Playbook)**: Telestration and whiteboard animations require precision (mouse/stylus) and larger screens.
    *   **Team Management & Admin**: Data-heavy tables, roster management, and financial dashboards are optimized for desktop/tablet.
    *   **Expert Marketplace**: Content creation and scheduling are complex tasks suited for larger screens.
