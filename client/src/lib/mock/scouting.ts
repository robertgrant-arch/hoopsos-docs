/**
 * Opponent Scouting domain model + mock data.
 *
 * Designed for high-school, AAU, and academy coaches. The model is
 * intentionally lightweight — no computer-vision extraction, no statistical
 * engine. Coaches enter tendencies manually; the system organises and
 * surfaces them at the right moment in the workflow.
 *
 * Production wiring:
 *   - Opponents stored in `opponents` table (org-scoped).
 *   - ScoutReport stored in `scout_reports` with JSONB for all arrays.
 *   - linkedEventId → events.id (game anchor).
 *   - linkedPracticePlanId → practice_plans.id.
 *   - linkedPlayIds → playbook plays tagged as "scout_team".
 *   - linkedClipIds → film_sessions clips.
