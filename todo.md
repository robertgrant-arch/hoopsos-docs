## Phase 17 — Practice Plan Builder + Playbook Studio Buildout (NEW REQUEST)

- [ ] Re-read Prompt 14 (Whiteboard/Playbook), Prompt 8 (Coach HQ practice plans), Prompt 3 (schema), audit existing PlaybookStudio + PracticePlans pages
- [ ] Extend mock data: drill library, practice plans, playbooks/plays/phases/diagrams/quizzes
- [ ] Practice Plan Builder
  - [ ] Drill library drawer with categories + search + filters
  - [ ] Period timeline with drag-add, drag-reorder, inline duration edit
  - [ ] Auto-summed running clock + warnings if over budget
  - [ ] Equipment / coach / court allocation summary
  - [ ] Print/share/export view
  - [ ] List + detail of multiple practice plans
- [ ] Playbook Studio
  - [ ] Half-court + full-court SVG backgrounds

  - [ ] Formation library
  - [ ] Save/version, list view, naming, tags
  - [ ] Coach presentation mode

## Phase 18 — Bug: links/login broken to Practice Plans + Playbook Studio
- [ ] Verify sidebar `Practice Plans` href matches the App.tsx route exactly
- [ ] Verify sidebar `Playbook Studio` href matches the new route
- [ ] Test sign-in flow on the deployed domain
- [ ] Test direct deep-links: `/app/coach/practice-plans` and `/app/playbook` after sign-in
- [ ] Patch any mismatched hrefs / missing routes


## Phase 19 — UX: marketing/demo-app boundary is confusing
- [ ] Audit every CTA on /, /coaches, /players, /teams, /experts, /pricing, /live
- [ ] "Start 14-day trial", "Start training" type CTAs → `/sign-in`
- [ ] Top-nav "Sign in" already routes to `/sign-in` — add a primary "Open Demo App" button next to it
- [ ] Add a dismissible banner across marketing routes: "This is the demo product page — sign in (no password) to use the actual app"


## Phase 20 — Prompt 16: Billing + Custom Drills addendum
- [ ] Custom Drills: extend Drill type with ownerCoachId, orgId, isCustom, visibility
- [ ] Custom Drills: My Drills tab + create/edit/delete dialog in Practice Plan Builder
- [ ] Custom Drills: localStorage-backed store + integration with existing drill drawer
- [ ] Billing seed: Subscription, Entitlement, CoachLinkEntitlement, Seat, Invoice, WebhookEvent, Coupon, PayoutAccount
- [ ] EntitlementService: grant/revoke/check + 50%-off engine with grandfathering + audit log
- [ ] Webhook simulator panel (admin)
- [ ] Pricing page wired to mock Checkout
- [ ] Customer Portal page (cancel/upgrade/pause/resume)
- [ ] Seat management UI for Team Pro (add/remove/swap with proration)
- [ ] Dunning banner + grace period UX
- [ ] Refund flow (subs / live / expert review SLA)
- [ ] Expert payout panel + 15% platform fee math
- [ ] Metered AI credits
- [ ] Admin Analytics: MRR, ARR, churn, LTV, ARPU
- [ ] Update architecture + schema docs
- [ ] Wire into Coach HQ / Player / Team / Expert / Admin nav
- [ ] QA + checkpoint


## Phase 21 — Drill Library toolbar layout fix
- [ ] Re-read DrillLibraryDrawer header markup
- [ ] Refactor into 4 sub-containers: header / tabs / search+chips / filters+matched
- [ ] Use flex-wrap + min-widths so nothing overlaps at any width
- [ ] Add 2-column grid on >=1024px for bottom (search+chips | filters)
- [ ] Verify desktop/tablet/mobile, save checkpoint


## Phase 22 — Custom Drill modal: number-input editing bug
- [ ] CustomDrillEditor: switch durationMin/coaches/minPlayers/maxPlayers to raw-string state
- [ ] Normalize via parseInt/clamp only on blur + submit
- [ ] Re-verify clearing & retyping any value works smoothly
- [ ] Save checkpoint + republish


## Phase 23 — Claude code review fixes for CustomDrillEditor
- [ ] Build NumericInput primitive (raw-string internal state, normalize on blur)
- [ ] Module-level normalizePositiveInt(v, opts?) — fallback defaults to min
- [ ] Drop defaultDurationMin/coachesNeeded/min/maxPlayers from `form`; derive at save
- [ ] canSave reads live numStr values via normalizePositiveInt
- [ ] Replace local Label div with <label htmlFor=> + stable id on every input/select
- [ ] aria-pressed on visibility option buttons
- [ ] aria-label on equipment + coaching point remove buttons
- [ ] Import ReactNode where needed
- [ ] Replace BudgetInput/SeatCountInput/AddSeatDialog with NumericInput
- [ ] TS check, save checkpoint, redeploy
