/**
 * Parent-portal access control.
 *
 * Every /api/parent/* endpoint that touches a specific player calls
 * validateParentChildAccess() before returning data.  This enforces:
 *
 *   1. The requesting user has a player_guardians row for the player.
 *   2. That row is in the same org (defense-in-depth against cross-org leaks).
 *   3. The guardian account has been linked (guardianUserId is not null).
 *
 * This is the server-side enforcement of the "parent can only see their
 * linked child" rule.  Client-side nav filtering is UX only; this is the gate.
